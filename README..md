**Kids will have a chance between four activities on the website in the DMV area.**

* _Library_, _Amusement parks_, _Museums_, and _bookstores_, all of these will be `tabs`.
* Each tab will have a single `html page`. We will use `javascript`, `mysql`, `express` to integrate with api's that are available from finding events from each activity.
* Users will be able to login with their own credentials saved by `mysql` and will to be able to post comment on each activity.
